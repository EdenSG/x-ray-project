### What are X-Rays?

X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, classified as having a wavelength from 0.01nm to 10nm, or frequencies from 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10<sup>16</sup> Hz to 3×10<sup>19</sup> Hz). X-rays are used for medical scanning because softer tissues are transparent to X-rays, whereas more dense tissues such as bone are opaque. There are many types of medical X-ray procedures, including projectional radiography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography, and mammography. I will be focusing on projectional radiography, where a two-dimensional image is formed on a film sensitive to x-rays or more recently on CCD sensors designed to detect x-rays. 

### Projectional Radiography

X-rays are fired out of an x-ray tube[^x-ray_tube] towards the subject, where they pass through or are absorbed by various tissues to varying amounts. The x-rays then hit the sensor that measures the levels.
