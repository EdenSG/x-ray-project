### What are X-Rays?

X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, classified as having a wavelength from 0.01nm to 10nm, or frequencies from 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10<sup>16</sup> Hz to 3×10<sup>19</sup> Hz). X-rays are used for medical scanning because softer tissues are transparent to X-rays, whereas more dense tissues such as bone are opaque. There are many types of medical X-ray procedures, including projectional radiography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography, and mammography. I will be focusing on projectional radiography, where a two-dimensional image is formed on a film sensitive to x-rays or more recently on CCD sensors designed to detect x-rays. 

Today the most common type of x-ray radiography is **phase-contrast imaging**, where the sensor uses the phase as well in the intensity of the incoming x-rays to create an image. X-rays are offset depending on the optical density of the material that is being imaged, because light moves more slowly in more optically dense materials. This technology allows for much more detailed images to be created with any increase in harmful radiation exposure for patients.

#### X-ray Tubes

An **x-ray tube** is a device that emits x-rays. There are quite a few types of x-ray tubes, but Coolidge tubes are the type that are by far the most common today. Tubes work by shooting electrons from an cathode filament (similar to a light bulb) towards an angled cathode target, usually made of tungsten. When the electrons hit the target, the electrons in the tungsten atoms jump to a higher energy level and then jump back, releasing electromagnetic radiation. Tungsten atoms release x-rays, but other materials will release different frequencies of radiation when bombarded with electrons (this is the same principle as is used in fluorescent light bulbs).

### Interesting facts

* There are two types of x-rays: *soft x-rays* and *hard x-rays*. Soft x-rays are usually defined as within the range of 10nm to 100pm (10<sup>-8</sup>m to 10<sup>-10</sup>m), whereas hard x-rays are between 100pm and 10pm (10<sup>-10</sup>m to 10<sup>-11</sup>m).
* X-rays carry about 1,000,000 times the energy of visible light.
* They were first studied by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1885, and by Nickola Tesla in 1884.
* X-rays were first used medically in January 1896 in Birmingham, England to see a needle stuck in a patient's hand.
* The most common type of x-ray tube is the Coolidge tube, which works by shooting electrons at an anode target.

### How an x-ray is taken

X-rays are fired out of an x-ray tube towards the subject, where they pass through or are absorbed by various tissues to varying amounts. The x-rays then hit the sensor that measures the levels.
